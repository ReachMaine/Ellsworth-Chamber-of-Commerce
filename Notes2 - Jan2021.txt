Notes for Search & Go V2 mods/

- S&G when getting user listings checks the user's package (not the listing's package)
	override the funtions that gets the user's listings package BUT the function is in a plugin (eltd-listing)

Issues
 - 1.  wp-admin / ajax problem on on pop-up login screen
 			=> idea.... use wp-login then redirect contributers to dashboard  (in ecc.php)

 - 2.  S&G checks to see if user has packages (not listing) and we are NOT USING PACKAGES!
 			-> override the eltd_listing_user_listings() in dashboard_functions.php of plugin eltd-listing

 - 3.  Allow Admin to change listing package.
 			=> ? use ACF with post_meta of listing....  (hide s&g's package in admin)

 - 4.  Only show allowable fields based on listing package (post_meta)
									on front end
									on front end edit.
